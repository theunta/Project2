- dynamic encounters with different stat combinations

# Project live at: https://tranquil-mountain-01754.herokuapp.com/

## Process and planning
I had a pretty set idea on how i wanted the website to look and function, it was just a matter of learning SQL, sinatra and ruby. In the end I'm happy with the outcome but would have liked to have spent more time on it to fix bugs.

My wireframing and diagrams:

## Bugs
- css wont load on heroku
- cant display enemy type (strength,agility,magic)
- delete button kind of breaks everything so hid it

## Features i want to add
- animations for the encounters!
- more classes
- scaling difficulty
- revamp battle system (currently random rock paper scissors)
- character stat sheet
- items
